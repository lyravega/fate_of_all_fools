* Issue #54: Shrink size of question mark and thumbs-down icons for consistency. (things looked a bit hokey with a massive THUMBS-DOWN in the middle of your vault :)
* Issue #40: Dupe indicator uses old style 'M' (mod installed) checking. This might be a bug? (didn't ultimately cause an issues though I did change it to use `data-fate-base-light` instead)
* Modify opacity to increase readability of markers and stats.
