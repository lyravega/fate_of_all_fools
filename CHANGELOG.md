* Issue #57: Dupe icon on kinetic weapons is in its old place (and new place).

* Issue #54: Shrink size of question mark and thumbs-down icons for consistency. (things looked a bit hokey with a massive THUMBS-DOWN in the middle of your vault :)
* Issue #53: Relocate "FATE Config" as it overlays / is hidden by character and vault contents. (moved to the nav now)
* Issue #43: Any time .isJunk() is used outside of the initial weapon decorator should be moved to an attribute check. (strive to use the weapon database only for initial decoration)
* Issue #40: Dupe indicator uses old style 'M' (mod installed) checking. This might be a bug? (didn't ultimately cause an issues though I did change it to use `data-fate-base-light` instead)
* Modify opacity to increase readability of markers and stats.
